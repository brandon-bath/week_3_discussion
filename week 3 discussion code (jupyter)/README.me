This project trains a machine learning model to identify images of single handwritten digits (0–9).

Dataset
I used the Digits dataset from scikit-learn. Each sample is an 8×8 grayscale image that is flattened into 64 pixel values. The labels represent which digit the image is.

Model
I used a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with two hidden layers:
Layer 1: 64 neurons
Layer 2: 32 neurons
Activation: ReLU
Optimizer: Adam

The input data was scaled before training to help the model learn more effectively.

Results
The model reached about 96% accuracy** on the test data.
